\section{Conclusion}
\hspace{\parindent}The next steps to further optimize the kernel would be to finish the improved parallel reduction and the intra-block distance balancing. They will likely only improve the speed by a small amount though. 

% Prob could do loop unrolling, finish the parallel reduction, finish the intra-block balancing, tweak the model some.
